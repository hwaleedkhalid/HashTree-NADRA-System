# NADRA System Project

## Project Description
This repository contains the solution for a NADRA ID-System project. The project implements a system using hashing and trees to support fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations[^1^][1]. The solution is custom-built and does not rely on built-in libraries for hashing, trees, lists, and graphs[^2^][2].

## Features
  - Custom hash function design for minimal collisions
  - Hash table with linear probing and chaining methods
  - Linked-list and BST-based chaining for collision resolution
  - AVL chaining for efficient balancing (Bonus Part)
  - Performance analysis comparing linear probing, linked-list chaining, BST chaining, and AVL chaining[^3^][3][^4^][4]

## Installation and Usage
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  2. Compile the C++ code using a standard C++ compiler like `g++`.
  3. Run the executable generated.
  4. Follow the on-screen menu for operations like searching, insertion, and deletion.

## Testing
The project includes three different data arrays of size 1000 (prime, odd, and even numbers) for insertion and searching[^5^][5]. These are randomly generated NADRA ID-card numbers following the format `aaaaa-fffffff-g`.

## Performance Analysis
The repository includes a comparison analysis of different collision resolution techniques and their performance in terms of the number of searches and collisions.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.



## The question for this solution is as follow:

Suppose that NADRA hires you as an IT expert for advancing their ID-System. Your goal is to design 
a system that supports fast searching/insertion/deletion.  

Array and Linked-list-based implementation led you to O(n) time complexity for 
searing/insertion/deletion in the worst case. AVL trees led to log(n), but balancing and high depth are 
the major concerns in this scenario.  

So, plan something else.   

Think before reading the solution.  
â€¦  
Hashing can be a solution, but collision is a problem that you have to deal with for the best performance.  
Task 1: Design a hash function that should perform best (nearly best, in terms of the number of 
collisions). Insert data into a hash table using the designed hash function.

Task 2: To avoid collisions, implement the linear probing technique.   
Now, note the problem with deletion. To avoid deletion problems, implement a chaining method. 

Task-3: Implement linked-list-based chaining.  

Task-4: Implement BST-based chaining.  
NOTE: Your system must be able to perform insertion/deletion/searching in every case 
(chaining/probing).  

**HINT for NADRA-ID-based hash function: **
Format: aaaaa-fffffff-g  
Get the first five numbers and get a key from your designed hash function. Similarly, get the next seven 
numbers and get a key from your designed hash function. Utilize the answers (keys) of both hash 
functions and apply another function/formula to get a single key. 

_NOTE: It is not necessary to use this technique, you can design your own way to get the key. _

**DATA: **
Use randomly generated ID-card numbers for insertion and searching. Be careful about the format of 
the ID card numbers. 

Compare the linear probing, linked-list chaining, and BST chaining. State the best method in terms of 
searching. State the reasons as well.  

For comparison, store 1000 randomly generated ID card numbers and search 100 randomly generated 
ID card numbers. You have to report the total and average number of collisions for the insertion of 1000 
data elements. You are also required to report the average and total number of comparisons for 
searching 100 data elements. 

_Note: Besides comparison, your system will also display a proper menu for searching/deletion/insertion 
of the user input ID card numbers. Randomly generated ID card number insertion and searching can 
only be used for comparison. So, make it clear. _


**`Project Part-02 `**
Comparison Data 
Get 3 different data arrays (of size 1000) and insert them into a hash table. Compare linear probing, 
linked list chaining, and BST chaining in terms of searching (search at least 100 times in each case).  

Data-1: 3, 5, 61, 19, 13, 23, 29, 17, 7, 11 (all prime numbers (1000 numbers), should not be consecutive) 

Data-2: 25, 65, 21, 91, 33, 15, 27, 35, 55 (all odd numbers (1000 numbers), should not be consecutive) 

Data-3: 70, 50, 60, 90, 100, 32, 50, 40, 12 (all even numbers (1000 numbers), should not be 
consecutive)  
    a) Insert Data-1 using linear probing, linked-list chaining, and BST chaining. Search different 
      randomly generated 100 numbers for each case. Show the average and the total number of 
      searches that you performed for searching 100 numbers for every case.  
    b) Insert Data-2 using linear probing, linked-list chaining, and BST chaining. Search different 
      randomly generated 100 numbers for each case. Show the average and the total number of 
      searches that you performed for searching 100 numbers for every case.  
    c) Insert Data-3 using linear probing, linked-list chaining, and BST chaining. Search different 
      randomly generated 100 numbers for each case. Show the average and the total number of 
      searches that you performed for searching 100 numbers for every case.
    
Which technique is better? State the reasons.  
**Instructions:** The hash function should be optimal in terms of the number of collisions. The number of 
collisions should be as minimum as possible. Moreover, the size of the hash table should be efficient in 
terms of space. You have limited resources only.  

For part 2, you are only required to generate 1000 random numbers for insertion and 100 numbers for 
searching. No menu is required in this part. No deletion or individual data insertion and searching is 
required. You have to count the total number of collisions and searching-comparison in this part. 

**Hashing Rule:** For size, avoid the powers of 2 and numbers close to the multiple of 10. Use the Prime 
number for the size of a hash table (Recommended). 

**BONUS (up to 3 absolute marks):** 
Implement an AVL chaining in part 2 only. The rest of the project will be the same. Add an AVL 
chaining analysis as well (i.e., you have to compare the data (in terms of the total number of collisions 
and searches) on the basis of linked-list chaining, BST chaining, AVL chaining, and linear probing)
